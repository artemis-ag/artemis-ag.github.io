## Welcome to the Artemis developer's portal!

If you're a developer working on integrating with the Artemis API, the team of developers at Artemis has aggregated some documentation that can help you get started and work with our code.

### Documentation

- [API Documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Artemis-Ag/Artemis-Ag-V3/1.0.0-oas3#/)

The most current version of the Artemis API is v3 and it is documented on Swaggerhub. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. To get your Artemis app id and app secret, you will need your Artemis account to be flagged as a developer account. If it has been, you can create an OAuth application from the Artemis settings page. If you're not flagged as a developer account and you need to be, please contact [jhampton@artemisag.com](mailto:jhampton@artemisag.com) and we'll help you get set up.

 - [The Artemis API gem](https://github.com/artemis-ag/artemis_api)

 We also have an API wrapper gem that you can use in your Ruby app to make calling our API easier and more readable. The documentation and source code is available on github.

 Note: Our gem has not been published on rubygems yet. To include it in your Ruby app, use this line in your gemfile:

 ```ruby
 gem 'artemis_api', :git => 'https://github.com/artemis-ag/artemis_api'
 ```

### Support

If you need help getting set up with the Artemis API or you encounter any problems with the provided documentation, the Artemis team is here to help. Please contact [our Developer Advocate, Jamey Hampton](mailto:jhampton@artemisag.com), with any questions or concerns you may have.
